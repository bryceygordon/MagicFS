# 📊 Project Status: Snowflake Arctic Experiment

## Current Branch: `experiment/snowflake-xs`
**State:** 🟢 Stable
**Model:** Snowflake Arctic Embed XS (384 dimensions)
**Isolation:** `~/.magicfs_arctic`

## Experiments
- **BGE-M3:** ❌ Aborted (Enum missing in dependency)
- **Nomic:** ❌ Aborted (Semantic Dilution, Score: 0.41)
- **Snowflake XS:** ✅ Working, but resolution limited (Score: 0.41)

## Next Objective
Upgrade to **Snowflake Arctic Medium** (768 dimensions) to solve semantic dilution via higher vector resolution.
